This application has been through many phases from where it started to now
When the app was in its initial stage it was still lacking and underperfoming
When the app began the code was all over the places unstructured and messy so that was one of the things i improved on
I added brief and short understandable comments so that the code could be easier to understand.
The overall ui elements stayed the same 
the functionality of the app has increased greatly since the first stages 
I have also addded error messages when the user has inputed a incorrect ipnput
Overrall the application has becomre smoother and easier to understand.
